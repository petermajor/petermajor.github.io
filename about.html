				<p>I've been working as a software engineer since 1996. Over the last 18 years I've worked technologies. My favorites are probably VB, Delphi, C#, AngularJS and Xamarin.
				<p>What I love most about software development as a career is the pace of change. It requires that we continuously learn new skills and better ways of working. The environment we work in today is so different from only a few of years ago</p>
				<p>That’s why I want to stay in a technical role – I can’t imagine coming to work in a job that doesn’t change. When I’m sixty I hope I’ll still be banging out code with the youngest and brightest, reminiscing back to the days when we still used keyboards.</p>
